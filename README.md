# Network-Security-Project
# Title:Secure Network Topology Implementation with pfSense, Kali Linux, and Windows 10
# Overview:
In this project, we implemented a secure network topology using three virtual machines connected in a simulated enterprise environment. 
The setup included configuring a firewall, intrusion detection system, proxy server, and antivirus to enhance network security.
# Description:
- Developed a secure enterprise-level network topology using VirtualBox with Kali Linux, Windows 10, and pfSense VMs.
- Configured firewall (pfSense), IDS (Snort), proxy (Squid), and antivirus (ClamAV) to protect against common network threats.
- Performed security tests including ping sweep detection, port scanning, and website blacklisting.
# Key Accomplishments:
- Successfully blocked malicious access attempts and blacklisted unauthorized websites.
- Detected network vulnerabilities using Nmap and mitigated risks by closing vulnerable ports.
- Configured security rules to prevent ICMP traffic and unauthorized remote access.
# Technologies:
- Tools: pfSense, Kali Linux, Windows 10, Snort, Squid, ClamAV, Nmap
- Skills: Network configuration, Intrusion detection, Proxy filtering, Vulnerability scanning, Firewall rules
